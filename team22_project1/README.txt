Hi professor!

To run our project on Linux, use the following command from the unzipped directory:

	python team22_project1.py

Everything should work fine except getting arguments disassembled correctly. Our biggest issue was with shifting and masking in python. Next time we'll be sure to set asside more time to account for this.

Thanks for the awesome project and opportunity! We both learned a lot.
